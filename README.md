# CPU Monitor

The purpose of this class is to monitor the CPU usage and adjust the CPU governor based on the prediction of a machine learning model. It also logs the energy consumption and power cost.

## Features

- **CPU Usage Monitoring**: The script monitors the CPU usage in real-time and logs it in an SQLite database.

- **Power Cost Monitoring**: The script fetches the current power cost from Nordpool and logs it in the database. It also categorizes the power cost into low, mid, or high categories based on thresholds defined in the configuration file.

- **Governor Adjustment**: The script adjusts the CPU governor based on the prediction of a machine learning model. The model is trained on CPU usage and power cost data.

- **Energy Consumption Logging**: The script logs the energy consumption for a given time interval using Eco2AI.

- **Multithreading**: The script creates a separate thread for each CPU to monitor the CPU usage and adjust the governor.

- **Machine Learning Model Training**: The script trains a Random Forest classifier on a synthetic dataset generated by the `make_classification` function from `sklearn.datasets`. The model is trained when the script is run for the first time and no pre-trained model (`model.pkl`) is found. The trained model is then saved to a file (`model.pkl`) for future use.

## Configuration

The script reads a configuration file (`cpumonitor.conf`) to get the necessary configuration parameters. Here's an example of a configuration file:

```conf
[general]
area = SE1
sleep_time = 60

[cost_thresholds]
low = 0.1
mid = 0.2
high = 0.3
